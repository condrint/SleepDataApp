# SleepDataApp

Simple Android app that allows users (me) to store data about the length of time spent sleeping each night and how hard or easy it was to wake up in the morning. Hoping to maybe learn something about sleep cycles or something along those lines. Mostly, however, I am just trying to make something.

TODO:
-intercept and handle inputs in the wrong format
-display a confirmation message when data is saved
-allow deletion of data entries
-maybe some sort of linear regression function to predict when best to fall asleep/wake up
