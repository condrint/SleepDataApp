# SleepDataApp

Simple Android app that allows users (me) to store data about the length of time spent sleeping each night and how hard or easy it was to wake up in the morning. Utilizes a linear regression model to predict the ideal sleep length. [This website](https://examples.javacodegeeks.com/core-java/util/regex/matcher/validate-time-in-24-hours-format-with-java-regular-expression-example/) helped me make this small project. [Here's](https://youtu.be/kPbMQfTq5Js) a short demo of the app.

TODO:
- ~~intercept and handle inputs in the wrong format~~
- ~~display a confirmation message when data is saved~~
- ~~allow deletion of data entries~~
- ~~maybe some sort of linear regression function to predict when best to fall asleep/wake up~~
- ~~convert storage from shared preferences (hashmap) to array or anything else sensible that allows duplicates~~
- ~~clean up formatting / unused code / make UI prettier~~
- ~~fix rounding of sleep amount to closest hour~~
- ~~create a gif/video demonstration so nobody has to wonder if this compiles~~
